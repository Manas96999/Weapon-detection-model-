Weapon Detection Model
Overview
This project implements a real-time weapon detection system using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to enhance security by automatically identifying the presence of weapons (e.g., handguns, knives) in images or video streams. This system can be integrated into surveillance systems to provide early warnings for potentially dangerous situations. Furthermore, these techniques can be applied to drone cameras, enabling real-time weapon detection from aerial feeds for enhanced surveillance and security.

Features
Real-time Detection: Capable of processing video feeds for live weapon detection.

High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced deep learning models to achieve high precision in weapon identification.

Scalable: Designed to be adaptable for various deployment scenarios.

Customizable: Allows for training on custom datasets to improve performance for specific environments.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Frameworks: (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras)

Object Detection Algorithms: (e.g., YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD, Faster R-CNN)

Libraries:

OpenCV (for video and image processing)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Matplotlib (for visualization)

(Add any other specific libraries like scikit-learn, Pillow, etc.)

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Manas96999/Weapon-detection-model-.git
cd Weapon-detection-model-



Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate



Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Download Pre-trained Weights (if applicable):

If your model uses pre-trained weights (e.g., YOLO weights), download them and place them in the specified directory (e.g., ./weights/).

Provide specific instructions and a download link if necessary.

Usage
Running the Detection System
For real-time webcam detection (using laptop camera):

python app.py



This script is intended for use with your laptop's built-in camera.

For real-time detection (using external camera/module):

python appp.py



This script is designed to receive camera feed from an external module or camera source, potentially via a web interface or specific streaming protocol.

Configuration
You might need to adjust parameters in a configuration file (e.g., config.py or config.yaml) for model paths, confidence thresholds, etc. For example:

# config.py example
MODEL_PATH = "path/to/your/model.pt"
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5

Dataset
Description: Briefly describe the dataset used for training your weapon detection model (e.g., custom dataset, public datasets like COCO, Pascal VOC, or specialized weapon datasets).

Source: Provide links or information on where the dataset can be obtained or how it was created.

Annotation: Mention the annotation format (e.g., YOLO, Pascal VOC XML).

Model Training
Instructions: Detail the steps to train the model from scratch or fine-tune it.

python train_model.py --data_path path/to/dataset --epochs 100 --batch_size 16



Replace train_model.py with your actual training script name and provide relevant arguments.

Hyperparameters: List important hyperparameters used during training.

Hardware Requirements: Mention any specific GPU requirements if training is computationally intensive.

Results
Performance Metrics: Provide key performance metrics (e.g., mAP, precision, recall, F1-score) achieved by your model.

Examples: Include screenshots or GIFs demonstrating the model's detection capabilities.
